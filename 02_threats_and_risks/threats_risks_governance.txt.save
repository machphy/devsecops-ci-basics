====================================
TOPIC 1: THREATS, VULNERABILITIES, RISKS
====================================

Threat:
A threat is anything that can cause harm to a system.
Examples: hackers, malware, insiders, misconfigurations.

Vulnerability:
A vulnerability is a weakness in a system.
Examples: SQL injection bugs, unpatched servers, hardcoded secrets.

Risk:
Risk is the business impact when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

Simple formula:
Risk = Likelihood × Impact

Golden line:
A threat is a potential danger, a vulnerability is a weakness, and risk is the business impact when both combine.


====================================
TOPIC 2: GOVERNANCE & REGULATION
====================================

Governance:
Governance defines internal rules, policies, and accountability for security.

Examples:
- Password policy
- Access control rules
- Incident response process
- Change management policy

Regulation:
Regulation defines legal requirements imposed by law or industry standards.

Examples:
- GDPR
- HIPAA
- PCI-DSS

Difference:

Governance:
- Internal
- Defined by the organization
- Flexible

Regulation:
- External
- Defined by law
- Mandatory

Golden line:
Governance defines how security should be done; regulation defines what must be done legally.


====================================
TOPIC 3: THREAT MODELLING
====================================

Threat Modelling:
Threat modelling is the process of identifying potential attack paths before development.

Purpose:
- Think like an attacker
- Identify weak points early
- Design preventive controls

Basic Steps:
1. Identify assets (data, APIs, servers)
2. Identify entry points (login, APIs, file uploads)
3. Identify threats (SQL injection, XSS, credential theft)
4. Design controls (authentication, validation, logging)

STRIDE Model:
S - Spoofing
T - Tampering
R - Repudiation
I - Information Disclosure
D - Denial of Service
E - Elevation of Privilege

DevSecOps Mapping:
Threat modelling before coding = shift-left security.

Golden line:
Threat modelling identifies potential attack paths before development.


====================================
TOPIC 4: RISK MANAGEMENT
====================================

Risk Management:
Risk management is the process of deciding how to handle identified risks.

Risk Options:
- Mitigate: Fix the vulnerability
- Accept: Risk is acceptable
- Transfer: Use insurance or third parties
- Avoid: Remove the risky feature

Risk Formula:
Risk = Likelihood × Impact

Golden line:
Risk management balances security with business needs.


====================================
TOPIC 5: VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
====================================

Vulnerability Management:
Vulnerability management is the continuous process of finding, fixing, and tracking weaknesses.

Lifecycle:

1. Discover:
- Vulnerability scanning
- Bug bounty
- Logs and monitoring

2. Prioritize:
- CVSS score
- Exploitability
- Asset value

3. Remediate:
- Patch systems
- Fix configurations
- Update code

4. Verify:
- Rescan systems
- Validate fixes

Golden rule:
Not all vulnerabilities need immediate fixing.
