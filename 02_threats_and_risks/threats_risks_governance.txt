TOPIC 1: THREATS, VULNERABILITIES, RISKS
====================================

Threat:
A threat is anything that can cause harm to a system.
Examples: hackers, malware, insiders, misconfigurations.

Vulnerability:
A vulnerability is a weakness in a system.
Examples: SQL injection bugs, unpatched servers, hardcoded secrets.

Risk:
Risk is the business impact when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

Simple formula:
Risk = Likelihood × Impact

Golden line:
A threat is a potential danger, a vulnerability is a weakness, and risk is the business impact when both combine.
