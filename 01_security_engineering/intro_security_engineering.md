# Introduction to Security Engineering

Security engineering is the practice of designing systems that remain secure against threats while enabling business operations.

Security is not about making systems 100% secure, but about reducing risk to an acceptable level.

## What Does a Security Engineer Do?
- Identifies security risks
- Designs preventive controls
- Detects malicious activity
- Responds to incidents
- Balances security with usability

## Core Responsibilities
Security engineering follows the Prevent–Detect–Respond model:
- Prevent: Secure design, least privilege, secure pipelines
- Detect: Logging, monitoring, alerts
- Respond: Incident handling and recovery

## DevSecOps Connection
In DevSecOps, security engineers integrate security directly into CI/CD pipelines to prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production.

## Key Takeaway
Security engineering focuses on managing risk using the Prevent–Detect–Respond model rather than relying only on security tools.
