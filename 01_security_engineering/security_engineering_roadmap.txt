SECURITY ENGINEERING LEARNING PATH
====================================

INTRODUCTION

Security Engineers are critical to every organization’s security. Being a Security Engineer means designing secure systems, networks, and software, understanding threats and risks that can affect the organization, and assisting in responding to incidents.

This learning path provides a structured introduction to security engineering from multiple perspectives. Regardless of specialization (SOC, Red Team, Blue Team, DevSecOps, AppSec), understanding these elements enables proactive risk identification and mitigation and strengthens an organization’s security posture.

This path includes:
- Security engineering fundamentals and career foundations
- Network, system, and software security architecture and hardening
- Threats, risks, risk management, and threat modelling
- Incident response and cyber crisis management
- Application security and DevSecOps principles
